Release Notes - Version 0.7.0
=============================
This is the initial open source release of **collectord**.  This version supports BMP versions 1 - 3 (all drafts of BMP).   Considering Cisco and Juniper have implemented the latest BMP draft version, previous versions of BMP will be removed in subsequent releases.   

The openbmp UI is in its own github repo under [OpenBMP_UI](https://github.com/OpenBMP/openbmp_ui).


> This version bridges support between legacy drafts and the current draft and therefore lacks current peer up and latest report statistics.    The next version, 0.8.0 will contain the peer up and all report objects.
>
> New '**v_peers**' and '**v_peer_stats**' VIEW's will be implemented based on the new stats objects and peer_up notifications.
